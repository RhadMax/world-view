# world-view

This was the first group project assigned to us at the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp. I worked with collaborators Michael Barachkov, Trevor Fairbank, and Oakkar Aung. The assignment was to create a flushed out browser based app that made use of multiple API's to provide some user functionality while meeting a number of other specific criteria such as finding and implementing a new technology we had not yet been exposed to in class, ensuring user validation and other requirements. 

Our goal as a group was to create a site where users could search for an input (initially we were thinking locations but it works fairly well in a broader sense for search inputs) and be given a select few results in the form of news articles and images presented in an aesthetically pleasing but not overwhelming format. The key concept was that the content presented to the user would be both recent and relevant, thereby reducing the noise that is usually received when using a modern internet search engine to look into a topic. 

The new technology we made use of was a styling one, the parralax scrolling effect, which we all felt gave the site an appealing look which might keep users coming back in preference of a simpler looking and more text heavy search engine. We were given a little under a week of in class time to complete the project and left plenty of ideas in the icebox for how we could continue to develop World-View in the future. Our original concept included using an even wider net to fish for results, but doing the filtering up front for the user is also paramount to maintaining its' value.
